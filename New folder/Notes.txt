Day 7 : (07/05/25)

1)in the morning i have started learning @Output directives which is used for allowing parent component to use the data or event of the child component in short it is used for sending data or event from the child component to parent component but with this we have to use EventEmitter to make it act as a event and in the parent component we have to use that property or event of child inside the () binding

Note : is the api server is what we actally use and if yes then how to store the data in that
5) by mistakenly i deleted some of the dependencies which causes errors in the code

Day 8 : (08/05/25)

1) in the morning i tried to solve those errors which was occured yesterday and finally after some tries i solved the errors
2) after that started learning about what is observables
3) after that stored all the product details inside the db.json file inside the json server which i created yesterday
4) after that leanered how to use the get request using observables and httpclient service and finally get all the data by calling the api(here i got stuck for more than one hour because i was trying the method which is shown in tutorials but after that i asked tohid bhai for help and he told me not to use that method and finally he showed me other way and finally i got the concept ) (Note: First, start the json-server. Then, use HttpClient in your Angular service to make HTTP GET requests. Use an Observable to fetch data, and configure your app to provide HttpClient using provideHttpClient() in app.config.ts. and then subscribe the observable method inside the ngoninit method )
5) by this i have also learned about the lifecycle hook ngOnInit() which gets first executed when the angular create the component and injected the dependencies
6) also used post method to send the data inside the json for that i first used HttpClient service because of that i was able to create the property which is using the HttpClient service by that i used that property and the post method in which i have given the url and then the data which i want to post in my case added those products which
 user has clicked the button buy and that i push in the json server but for that i need to subscribe it then only it will get executed
